# Sketchy
This Python script uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to create a simple hand-drawing application. The application allows the user to draw on a canvas using different colors by detecting hand landmarks using Mediapipe.

## Features
- Draws on a canvas using hand gestures.
- Supports multiple colors: Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow.
- Clear button to reset the canvas.
- Save drawings as JPEG files.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Numpy (`numpy`)
- Mediapipe (`mediapipe`)

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
```

## Usage
- Run the script.
- Point your hand towards the camera.
- Use your index finger to draw on the canvas.
- Select different colors by positioning your hand in the corresponding color rectangles.
- Press 's' to save the drawing as a JPEG file.
- Press 'q' to quit the application.

## Controls
- 's': Save the current drawing.
- 'q': Quit the application.
